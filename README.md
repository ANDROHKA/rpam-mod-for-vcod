# Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop features requested by the player base while preserving the core gameplay at the highest competitive standard established in recent years. rPAM is the updated competition mod for Call of Duty 1.5 established by me in 2015, building on previous PAM releases that were used in eSports leagues such as ESL, ClanBase, CyberGamer. You can find visuals by scrolling down.

> **Join the CoDBASE Call of Duty 1 Community**: `Active and skilled European playerbase` [***Discord Invite Link***](https://discord.gg/Zh8DP7c)      

> **Background of PAM:**

Project Ares Mod (PAM) for Call of Duty (v1.5) was created by Garetjax and finalized with version 1.08. He laid the groundwork for competitive play in the game’s early days. Widely adopted in leagues such as ESL, ClanBase,
CAL, and TWL from the 2000s through the early 2010s, PAM enabled teams to compete in structured, rule-based matches without relying on manual setup, in-game commands, or RCON intervention. Thanks to its automation and reliability,
it quickly became the standard for high-level competitive play.    

> **Overall Goals Here:**
* Ensure that the game remains closely aligned with the legacy established between 2004 and 2011
* Provide server operators and players with a stable, easy-to-manage experience
* Fix bugs, retain and expand features introduced in CoDBASE-PAM (2024)
* Fully supported and integrated custom maps
* Revise textures, skins, and scripts to ensure fair and balanced competitive gameplay

A little throwback, back in 2007 or 2008, I managed to add this shown fifth button to the main menu. That’s why it says ‘hi world‘.
That was an personal achievement that I accomplished through trial and error over many hours of time without internet and knowledge to code. 
The images next to it are from 2010 to 2024 added to showcase a picture here. The following links do provide my work on single- and multiplayer.

# REISSUE LEANFIX

Full comparision between reissue-leanfix (2024/2025), expert-leanfix (2023) & default game (2003).  
In the default game the body rolls inwards while diagonal movement. Expert made an attempt and added an weird anim.
Here Reissue fixed the diagonal lean issue completely. The screeners explain it. Further changes applied.

      - Graveyard bush wall is no longer see-through

### Install Client:
- Go to `\Call of Duty\_rPAMv115``*` and run `_run_rPAM.cmd` to launch the game directly.
- Alternatively, start the Call of Duty Multiplayer normally and select `"rPAM Mod by reissue"` from the Mods menu.
- It is recommended to ensure that your `config_mp.cfg` settings are properly configured, as the file will be loaded from your `main` folder the first time you run the mod.

### Install Server:
- Add `seta fs_game "_rPAMv115*"` to your server config.
- Place the `_rPAMv115*` folder (with all mod files inside) next to the `main` folder in your Call of Duty game directory and also on your download ftp server.

### Recommendation:
- Players: Check or copy your `config_mp.cfg` from your `main` folder into the `_rPAMv115*` folder. Normally, it transfers automatically when launching the mod for the first time.
- Players: It is recommended you clear you `main` folder.
   - <a href="readme_images/cleared_main.png"><img src="readme_images/cleared_main.png"/> </a>
- Server Hosts: New players can download most of the required files directly by connecting to the game server by adding the following commands to the server config
`seta sv_allowDownload "1"`
`seta sv_wwwBaseURL "http://167.235.243.217/fastdl/cod1"` // Credits: bandiii92`
`seta sv_wwwDlDisconnected "1"`
`seta sv_wwwDownload "1"`
